# SWEAT - MVP Prototype

Demo Next.js app (cyberpunk theme) to showcase the "Sweat" loot-box experience. This is a **demo** (no real blockchain or money).

## Quick start (local)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Create a Git repository and push the project.
2. Sign in to Vercel and import the repo (Vercel auto-detects Next.js).
3. Deploy (no environment variables needed for demo).

## Notes
- Do **not** include any real keys here. The demo uses mock data.
- For investor demo: host on a private branch or a password-protected domain.
